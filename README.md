## My process

### Built with

- React JS
- Framer-Motion
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Decided to refeactor my previous solution that used vainlla JS and CSS and incorporated the
React framework. I also used Framer Motion to handle transitions and reordering of the todo list
to work well on desktop and mobile devices.

### Continued development

For future development, I would like to transform this into a full stack application. I will also use Express.js to handle routing and MongoDB to save users and their ‘todo’ data.
